# Enumerable Methods with Ruby

## Description
The objective of this exercise is to learn about Enumerable methods in Ruby by coding them from scratch.
The methods coded are:
- my_each that mimics the ruby built-in method "each"
- my_each_with_index
- my_select that mimics the ruby built-in method "select"
- my_all? that mimics the ruby built-in method "all?"
- my_any? that mimics the ruby built-in method "any?"
- my_none? that mimics the ruby built-in method "none?"
- my_count that mimics the ruby built-in method "count"
- my_map that mimics the ruby built-in method "map"
- my_inject that mimics the ruby built-in method "inject"
